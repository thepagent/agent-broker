# Contributing to OpenAB

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers what we expect in pull requests.

For the full rationale behind these guidelines, see the [PR Contribution Guidelines ADR](/docs/adr/pr-contribution-guidelines.md).

## Pull Request Guidelines

Every PR must address the following in its description. The [PR template](/.github/pull_request_template.md) will prompt you for each section.

### 0. Discord Discussion URL

We strongly recommend including a Discord Discussion URL in the PR body (e.g. `https://discord.com/channels/...`). Discussing your idea in Discord before opening a PR helps align on direction and avoids wasted effort. If no Discord discussion exists, explain the context directly in the PR description.

### 1. What problem does this solve?

Describe the pain point or requirement in plain language. Link the related issue.

### 2. Prior Art & Industry Research

**Required for architectural, runtime, agent, scheduling, delivery, or persistence changes.** For docs-only, chore, CI, release, or trivial bug fixes, write "Not applicable" with a brief reason.

When prior art research is required, investigate at minimum:

- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** — the largest open-source AI agent gateway
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** — Nous Research's self-hosted agent with multi-platform messaging

Include links to relevant source code, documentation, or discussions. If neither project addresses the problem, state that explicitly with evidence.

### 3. Proposed Solution & Why This Approach

Describe your technical approach, then explain why you chose it over the alternatives found in your research. Be explicit about:

- Tradeoffs you accepted
- Known limitations
- How this could evolve in the future

### 4. Alternatives Considered

List approaches you evaluated but did not choose, and explain why they were rejected.

### 5. Validation

Pick the checks relevant to your PR type:

- **Rust changes:** `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- **Helm chart changes:** `helm lint`, `helm template`
- **CI/workflow changes:** workflow syntax validation, dry-run where possible
- **Docs-only changes:** links are valid, renders correctly in GitHub preview

Describe any manual testing performed and add unit tests for new functionality.

## Why We Require Prior Art Research

OpenAB is a young project. We want every design decision to be informed by what's already working in production elsewhere. This:

- Prevents reinventing the wheel
- Surfaces better patterns we might not have considered
- Documents the design space for future contributors
- Makes reviews faster — reviewers don't have to do the research themselves

## Development Setup

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo check
```

## Code Style

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
