# Codex

Codex uses the [@zed-industries/codex-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp) adapter for ACP support.
The recommended working directory for the Codex image is `/home/node`; this is
also the container `HOME`, so Codex auth, sessions, generated images, and skills
live under `/home/node/.codex/`.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.codex -t openab-codex:latest .
```

The image installs `@zed-industries/codex-acp` and `@openai/codex` globally via npm.

## Helm Install

```bash
helm install openab openab/openab \
  --set agents.kiro.enabled=false \
  --set agents.codex.discord.enabled=true \
  --set agents.codex.discord.botToken="$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" \
  --set-string 'agents.codex.discord.allowedChannels[0]=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID' \
  --set agents.codex.image=ghcr.io/openabdev/openab-codex:latest \
  --set agents.codex.command=codex-acp \
  --set agents.codex.workingDir=/home/node
```

> Set `agents.kiro.enabled=false` to disable the default Kiro agent.

## Manual config.toml

```toml
[agent]
command = "codex-acp"
args = []
working_dir = "/home/node"
```

## Authentication

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- codex login --device-auth
```

Follow the device code flow in your browser, then restart the pod:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/openab-codex
```

### Persisted Paths (PVC)

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/home/node/.codex/auth.json` | Codex login credentials |
| `/home/node/.codex/config.toml` | Codex CLI settings and feature flags |
| `/home/node/.codex/sessions/` | Session history |
| `/home/node/.codex/generated_images/` | Built-in image generation outputs |
| `/home/node/.codex/skills/` | User-created Codex skills |

## Image Generation

Codex image generation is controlled by the Codex CLI feature flag
`image_generation`. Enable it once inside the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex features enable image_generation
```

This writes the following to `/home/node/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
image_generation = true
```

You can verify it with:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex features list | grep image_generation
```

Generated images are saved by Codex under
`/home/node/.codex/generated_images/...`. If the user needs a stable path, ask
Codex to copy the selected output into `/home/node`, for example
`/home/node/sky-birds.png`.

> Note: Codex image generation may return a model-native size rather than the
> exact dimensions requested in the prompt. If exact dimensions matter, resize
> only when the user explicitly asks for it.

### Quick Imagegen Smoke Test

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex exec \
    --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
    --enable image_generation \
    --skip-git-repo-check \
    -C /home/node \
    "Use the imagegen skill and the built-in image_gen tool. Generate a simple image of birds flying across a bright sky. Save or copy the final PNG to /home/node/sky-birds.png. Report the output path and dimensions."
```

Then check for output:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  sh -lc 'ls -lh /home/node/sky-birds.png /home/node/.codex/generated_images/*/* 2>/dev/null | tail'
```

## Sending Generated Images Back to Discord

OpenAB streams text over ACP only. It does **not** relay image attachments from
Codex back to Discord. To send a generated image, Codex must call the Discord
REST API directly. See [sendimages.md](sendimages.md) for the full protocol.

The agent should:

1. Read `thread_id` from OpenAB's `<sender_context>` and use it as the Discord
   target channel. If `thread_id` is absent, fall back to `channel_id`.
2. Upload the file with `POST /channels/{id}/messages` using multipart form
   data.
3. Read the token from `DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN` if available, otherwise
   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

Example upload from inside the pod:

```bash
THREAD_ID="1499442140172910654"
IMAGE="/home/node/sky-birds.png"

curl -X POST "https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/${THREAD_ID}/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot ${DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN:-$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}" \
  -F "content=Here is the generated image" \
  -F "files[0]=@${IMAGE}"
```

### Agent Environment for Uploads

The Discord bot token configured under `[discord]` is consumed by OpenAB itself.
For safety, OpenAB clears the inherited environment before spawning the agent and
only passes variables listed in `[agent].env`. If Codex should upload images
itself, explicitly expose an upload token to the agent:

```toml
[agent]
command = "codex-acp"
args = []
working_dir = "/home/node"
env = { DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN = "${DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN}" }
```

For production, prefer a dedicated "File Deliverer" Discord bot with only
`Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, and `Attach Files` permissions.
For small personal deployments, using the same bot token is simpler but gives
the agent the same Discord permissions as the main OpenAB bot.

## Recommended Skill

For repeated image requests, save the imagegen + Discord upload workflow as a
Codex skill under `/home/node/.codex/skills/`, for example:

```text
/home/node/.codex/skills/discord-imagegen-deliver/
+-- SKILL.md
`-- scripts/
    `-- send-discord-image.sh
```

The skill should instruct Codex to:

- Use the built-in `imagegen` skill and `image_gen` tool for raster images.
- Keep the generated image size as-is unless the user explicitly asks for
  resizing.
- Copy the selected file from `/home/node/.codex/generated_images/...` to a
  stable path under `/home/node`.
- Upload it to `thread_id` or `channel_id` using the Discord REST API.
- Avoid printing token values.

Example user prompt after creating such a skill:

```text
Use $discord-imagegen-deliver to generate a warm hand-painted sky with birds and send it back to this Discord thread.
```

## Troubleshooting

### `bwrap: No permissions to create a new namespace`

Some Kubernetes environments do not allow unprivileged user namespaces, which can
block Codex's default sandbox when running nested `codex exec` commands. For
manual smoke tests inside an already isolated pod, use:

```bash
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox ...
```

Do not use this flag on an untrusted host.

### Imagegen appears to hang

Check whether an image was generated even if the CLI has not returned yet:

```bash
find /home/node/.codex/generated_images -type f -name '*.png' -printf '%T@ %p %s\n' | sort -n | tail
```

If a file exists, copy it to a stable path and upload it manually with the
Discord API command above.

### No image upload appears in Discord

Verify the agent can see an upload token:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  sh -lc 'test -n "$DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" && echo token-present || echo token-missing'
```

Also confirm the bot has `Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, and
`Attach Files` permissions in the target channel or thread.
